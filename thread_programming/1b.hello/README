Question: Convert the supplied program to use threads.

The following restrictions apply:

	1) One thread will print "hello ", one thread will print "world",
		the main function will print the trailing "\n".

	2) The "world" thread will be created before the "hello" thread.

	3) Both the "hello" and "world" thread must run concurrently.

Hints & Tips:

	1) You must use a synchronization primitive to synchronize execution
		of the two threads; "hello" and "world".

	2) You must use a synchronization method to assure that the main
		thread does not execute until after the "world" thread.

	3) It is a shorter program if you use the Solaris thread library
		semaphore to synchronize between the "hello" and "world"
		threads.
