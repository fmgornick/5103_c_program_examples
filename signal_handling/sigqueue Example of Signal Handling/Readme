In this example,  sender.c program sends SIGUSR1 signal with an integer
value (given in command line arg) to the receiver process whose PID 
is specifed in command line arg. 

 Usage::
     sender receiverPD intValue
The sender process uses sigqueue system call to send a signal with some integer value.


receiver.c contains program code for the receiver process.  This process first prints its PID.
It then sets up a signal handler using sigaction system call.
In sigaction call it specifies sa_flags to include SA_SIGINFO flag to obtain the value associated with a signal.
The receiver process then makes sigsuspend call to wait for any signal to be delivered.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Compile both these programs
  gcc sender.c -o sender
  gcc receiver.c -o receiver

To run this example:

  receiver &   // This will print PID of receiver

  sender receiverPID someInteger

    man sigaction
    man sigqueue
